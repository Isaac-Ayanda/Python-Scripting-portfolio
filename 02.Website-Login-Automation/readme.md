![Login page](./images/loginpage.png)

### By inspecting the elements of the username and password on the webpage; we use find_element by  id since the input elements has an id attribute. 
![Webpage Inspect](./images/inspect.png)
### Then write the script that takes the supplied credential to login to the page. Then use the send.keys
