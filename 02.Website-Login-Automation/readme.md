![Login page](./images/loginpage.png)

### By inspecting the elements of the username and password input boxes on the webpage; we use find_element by  id since the input elements has an id attribute. 
![Inspect element username](./images/inspect.png)
![Inspect element password](./images/inspect2.png)
### Then write the script that uses the supplied credential to login to the page using the send.keys functions which expecting "automated" as username annd "automatedautomated" as the password.
